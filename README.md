# About the Project

In this project, we are focusing on designing the most exciting roller coaster that conforms to various constraints by considering different models of population.We are taking into account various factors such as G force, speed variation and the number of loops in the roller coaster track as variables which will in turn produce results to satisfy distinct levels of excitement of different groups of sensation seeking people based on their age. We will use a Genetic Algorithm to evolve the best combination of the aforementioned variables of design factors and come up with an optimum design.
